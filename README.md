# Spell of Balse / バルスの呪文
You can destroy your website developed on this system.

For example, if your great website gets flamed because of some reason, you can push the "Balse" button on the maintenance page to delete all files in every directory, so that you can escape from the annoying situation. (It might make the situation worse, though.)

![Maintenance Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53997809/63211341-cd643c00-c130-11e9-9280-d75c87f3bce7.png)

## Demo Site

https://balse.herokuapp.com/leete_latobarita_uruth_ariaroth_bal_netoreel

## Installation

* python 3.6.8
* flask 1.0.3

Install the following package:

```
$ pip install flask
```

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yoshy-toshy/balse.git
```

Start the server:
```
$ cd balse
$ python laputa_command.py
```

Access http://localhost:5000/leete_latobarita_uruth_ariaroth_bal_netoreel, and you can see the maintenance page.

[!] Do NOT move "laputa_command.py" to another folder. Otherwise, unexpected files will be deleted accidentally.

After pushing the button, the system will delete all the files except "laputa_command.py", and you can no longer access any page.
